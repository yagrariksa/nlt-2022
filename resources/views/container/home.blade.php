            National Leadership Training (NLT) is a national-level AMSA-Indonesia work program
            that is held annually. This program aims as a means of developing self-ability in
            organizing effectively and efficiently as well as increasing intimacy between
            AMSA-Indonesia members. At the National Leadership Training (NLT) 2022 event, AMSA-UNAIR,
            as the host university, raised the theme, namely MAHAVIRA (Mastering The Art of Heroism
            and Leadership in Virtuous Generation). In Sanskrit, 'Maha' means great and 'Vira' means
            brave. A leader is someone who has the ability to influence others and is responsible for
            the realization of a certain goal. Therefore, MAHAVIRA 2022 was held with the aim of being
            a lesson material to become a quality leader from the struggle of the heroes. The entire
            series of activities will be held online on March 25-27 2022 and will be attended by
            approximately 304 delegates from 38 universities.
